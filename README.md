# Information Retrieval Course Final Semester Project
This is my final semester project for Information Retrieval course. My team build a simple search engine to search books by keywords and shows some books that match.
Books that the title match with the keyword will be shown. The program also provides some menu. You can see a book's synopsis, search for other books, or exit from the program.
