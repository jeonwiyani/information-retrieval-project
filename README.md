# Information Retrieval Final Semester Project
This is the final semester project for Information Retrieval. My team build a simple search engine to search books by keywords and shows some books that match.
Books that the title match with the keyword will be shown. The program also provides some menu. You can see a book's synopsis, search for other books, or exit from the program.
